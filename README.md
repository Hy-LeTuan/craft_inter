# A reimplementation of the Lox interpreters in the Crafting Interpreters book by Robert Nystrom 

This repository also contains my answers and additional implementations for the challenges inside the book.

**Note:** The first, JLox was originally written in in Java. In this version, I translated the interpreter into C++, which means I have to add some functionalities to ensure no memory leaks happen since C++ doesn't have a garbage collector. This means that the code is NOT one-to-one translatable.
